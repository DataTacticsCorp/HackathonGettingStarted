# Objective

At this Hackathon, we will be creating [GoCD](http://www.go.cd) plugins.

# Intro

You should read the [code contribution
process](http://www.go.cd/contribute/contribution-guide.html#code-contribution-process).
You may also want to read the [Go "geeknight"
handout](geeknight_handout.doc) and [presentation](geeknight.pptx).

At the hackathon, we will be providing one GoCD server for each
hackathon team. The Vagrant definition for this server is hosted on our
[Vagrant GoCD repo fork and
branch](https://github.com/L3-DT-Hackathon/ansible-gocd/tree/hackathon).
Be aware that we have manually loaded in a customized `config.xml` which
includes a lot of hackathon-friendly pre-configuration. If you want to
try manually loading that file into your GoCD server, you can find it
[here](https://github.com/L3-DT-Hackathon/ansible-gocd/blob/hackathon/files/config.xml).

# 24pullrequests

GoCD is one of the projects at
[24pullrequests](http://24pullrequests.com). So, if you or someone else
wants to become a part of the giving back during the hackathon, that's
cool too. Your name and commits get mentioned on their site.
